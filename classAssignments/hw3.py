myList = [87, 97, 100, 100, 59, 98, 77, 79, 81, 85, 70]

#define a function called "average" that takes in myList as an argument
# 1. print the average in a string called "The average is X" -> where X will be the average you find
#you are not allowed to use built in functions like sum() (use a loop)
# 2. create a list that only contains even scores and print the list
# 3. iterate through the list of scores and 
#    if that score is above an 80 and an even number score -> print "This score is above 80 and even"
#    if a score is below the average or is a 70 or lower -> print "Do better next time"
#    if a score is a 100 print "Perfect!"
# 4. In another loop, iterate through the loop and 
#    print out each score if the score equals 100 print "Perfect Score!" and immediately break from the loop
# 5. return 0 when you are done

'''write code here (you should have a total of three separte loops (One loop for 1&2, One loop for 3, and One loop for 4))'''

'''end of code'''        

#make sure to call your function!
