# How to check your homework
- First download "homeworkChecker.py"
    (Make sure this is in your downloads folder, if not, use your terminal/command prompt
        to "cd" into the proper directory to run the file)

- Once you are in the right directory run your homework assignment and it will produce some output
    For example, "this is output of your code"

- To check your homework type this command in the image below:
    (where it says "this is output of your code" that is where you will put the output of your homework you just executed) 

![plot](/img/commandSnip.png)  

- You will then get an output with a hash value. This hash should match exactly with the hashes below 
    for each Homework Assignment

## *Make sure your output is in quotation marks*
