# Problem Statement

You are given a list of words. Your task is to write a Python program that will check each word in the list and classify it into one of three categories based on the following rules:

1. If the word starts with "a" and is shorter than 5 characters, print "Short a-word".
2. If the word contains the letter "e" or "o" and is longer than 7 characters, print "Long e-o word".
3. If the word is longer than 10 characters and does not meet the above criteria, print "Long word".
## Input
You do not need to take any input from the user. The list of words is already provided for you.

## Output
Your program should output the classification for each word in the list in the following format:

```python
apple is Short a-word
love is Long e-o word
program is Long word
machines is Long e-o word
learning is Long word
python is Long word
air is Short a-word
happiness is Long e-o word
networks is Long word
```

## Requirements
Your program should meet the following requirements:

1. Your program should be written in Python 3.
2. Your program should use if, elif, and else statements with logical operators to classify the words.
3. You should not use any input() or raw_input() functions to take input from the user.
4. Your program should output the classification for each word in the list in the format shown above.
